This project is a frontend application for an airline management system where users can search and book flights, and administrators can manage flights and passenger information. It includes user registration, login, flight search, booking functionalities, and an admin dashboard. The application validates user inputs, saves necessary data in local storage, and retrieves it to display flight, booking, and user information.
